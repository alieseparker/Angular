# Codeschool - AngularJS

This is a gemstore app built through the codeschool AngularJS
course.

All I have done extra so far is build a rails app and get it to
deploy to a server.

Added an API!
  You can access the products through /products and then convert the data to symbols so you can return whatever it is you're looking for.

  There's basic Create, Read, Update, Destroy funcitonality.

  Unfortunately I have yet to figure out how I should add images to the mix.
  Also, there currently is not any funcitonality behind the reviews.  I'll be getting on to that soon.
